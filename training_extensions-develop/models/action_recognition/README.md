# Action Recognition

## Pre-trained models

This repo contains scripts and tutorials for action recognition models training.

* [Custom Action Recognition](model_templates/custom-action-recognition/README.md) - models that are
  trained on the [Kinetics-700](https://deepmind.com/research/open-source/kinetics) dataset 
  and suitable for transfer learning.
* [Gesture Recognition](model_templates/gesture-recognition/README.md) - models that are able
  to recognize hand gestures (e.g. American Sign Language (ASL) and [Jester](https://20bn.com/datasets/jester)).
