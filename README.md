# Deaf-VOIP-Empowerment # 

# About the Project # 
This project was created under the VolHacks 2021 competition, and it's purpose was to empower deaf people to make phone calls without the need of a 3rd party interpreter. This 3rd party interpreter is the current standard to enable deaf people to make phone calls. Yet this methodology can create a disconnect between the desired receiver and deaf individual due to the additional party on the phone call. 

With this software, a deaf person can communicate directly to the receiving party with the assistance of machine learning interpreting ASL in real-time. 

# Technologies used #
VoiceEmpowerment was built in Google Collab and utilizes their GPU accelerators. Without this feature, the project would not have been possible due to the amount of computing power needed to train the models. Beyond Google Collab, the research of <b>Author</b> was extremely helpful for the ASL interpretation models. His research utilizes the use of <b>model1</b> and GCN networks. 

SignalWire's software was used to combat the issue of getting real-time text to speech over VoIP. Their API was immensly important to the project and you can check them out [here](https://signalwire.com/ "SignalWire's homepage").
